# ConcurrentServerProject

- **Introduction**

SP-Project 2   -   'Event-based & Thread-based Concurrent Stock Server' Program

<br>

- **Summary**

This Project is implementing the Event-based & Thread-based Concurrent Stock Server. I developed this program based on a deep understanding of I/O Multiplexing, Thread Programming, Concurrency, Producer-Consumer Problem, Readers-Writers Problem. More details are on the Document file attached.

<br>

- **Requirements**

To execute this program successfully, you need to generate an account on CSPRO server('sftp://cspro.sogang.ac.kr') because this program is suitable to run on ssh shell on CSPRO. Of course, you can run this program on almost all version of ssh shell, not only on CSPRO.

<br>

- **Installation**

Unzip the coserver.tar file with 'tar -xvzf' command. After the unzip completes(you may already reach this step since you read this txt file), go to 'sp2' folder and compile source codes with 'make' command. After this, open two ssh prompt, use one as a server and the other as multiclient, with any network ports. Enjoy!

- **Configuration**

~> sp2 folder with event-based, thread-based

~> event-based folder with csapp.c, csapp.h, Makefile, multiclient.c, stock.txt, stockclient.c, stockserver.c

~> thread-based folder with csapp.c, csapp.h, Makefile, multiclient.c, stock.txt, stockclient.c, stockserver.c

~> document.pdf
